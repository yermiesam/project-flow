# project-flow
Application to interact with project and permits on government databases.

As a project manager for a local water utility department, I'm constantly curating the project database. Moving emails to corresponding files, accessing/pulling existing documents, etc. Just a bunch of mundane task that interrupt my "work" flow (please see note 1. for _def. of __work__).

With the "project-flow" application, I want to remove all record manipulation on the public database out of the human hands. The clients (general public, contractors, engineers, city employees, etc.) state it's business and the flow app retrieve all the necessary documentations, inform all the pertinent stake holders, update records, etc.

The users of this app should only focus on the creative tasks (please see note 2.)

### NOTE:

1. I define "__work__" or "**work flow**" as all the actions taken by an employee that produce value. Regardles if the action fall in the employee's position-work-scope.
2. __Creative Task__ is the act of implementing human interpratation or solution to a problem. If a computer can provide the solution or interpratation is not a _creative task_.
   -  The oposit to creative task is __Automated Task__.
   -  Everythin else that is not automated, but is not creative is a __Mundane Task__ and should be automated.
